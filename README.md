# AutoSkipYT
## ⚠️ Project Status: In Development

AutoSkipYT is a browser extension designed to automatically skip YouTube ads and mute them in the meantime. Currently, it:

✅ Mutes video ads  
✅ Detects the skip ad button  
⚠️ Simulates a click on the skip button (click is firing, but not always successful in skipping)

Further improvements are being explored to increase reliability, including stronger event simulation, user gesture mimicking, and DOM structure analysis.

Pull requests and issues welcome!
