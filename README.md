# AutoSkipYT

## Project Status: In Development

**AutoSkipYT** is a browser extension designed to reduce interruption from YouTube ads by automatically muting them and attempting to click the "Skip Ad" button when it becomes available.

### Current Features

- Mutes video ads automatically
- Detects YouTube's "Skip Ad" button
- Simulates a click on the skip button (firing successfully, though ad-skipping is not always achieved)

### In Progress

- Improving reliability of the skip click using deeper DOM inspection
- Testing alternative event simulation strategies
- Refining mutation observation and performance
